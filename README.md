# Udemy Clone Project

This repository contains the source code for a Udemy clone website created using HTML and basic CSS. The project is currently not responsive, but plans are in place to make it responsive in the near future.

## Overview

The Udemy clone is a non-responsive prototype that emulates the basic structure and design elements of the popular online learning platform, Udemy. It includes key features such as course listings, individual course pages, and a simple navigation system.

## Technologies Used
